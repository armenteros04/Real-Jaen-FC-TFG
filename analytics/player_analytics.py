"""Phase 6 — player performance analytics.

Turns the Phase 5 :class:`~analytics.analytics_models.AnalyticsResult`
(distance / speed per track) into per-player performance: work rate, activity
level, fatigue, an overall 0..10 rating, a performance status and an
AI-style insight sentence. Metrics are normalized RELATIVE TO THE SQUAD in
this match (so a rating reflects standing among teammates, not absolute
units), via :mod:`analytics.rating_engine`. Phases 1-5 are untouched — this
only reads their output.
