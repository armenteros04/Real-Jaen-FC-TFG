"""Appearance-based ID-swap correction (post-tracking).

When two players cross, BoT-SORT can *exchange* their IDs: a track that
was blue becomes red and the other goes red->blue. Stitching can't fix
this (both tracks stay alive the whole time) — it's a concurrent swap, not
a broken/gap track.

This module detects swaps from jersey appearance. Each track is given a
team label per sampled frame; a track whose label *flips* mid-way is
paired with another track that flips the OPPOSITE way at the same time and
place (they crossed), and their identities are swapped back from the
crossing frame onward — so each player keeps one consistent id + team.

Pure helpers (``detect_flip``, ``match_swaps``, ``apply_swaps``) are
unit-testable without any video; :class:`SwapCorrector` wires in the crop
sampling + team clustering.
