## 📖 Overview

**AI Football Analytics** is a graduation project that processes a football
video from raw frames all the way to an analyst-grade report. It detects and
tracks every player, goalkeeper, referee and the ball, discovers the two teams
from their kit colours, projects the action onto a real-metre pitch, and then
computes speed, distance, heatmaps, possession, tactical profiles and a
per-player rating — finishing with a natural-language match report.

> **Design principle — nothing is hard-coded.** Teams, jersey colours, pitch
> geometry and player roles are all *learned per match* from the footage. The
> same command runs on any match, with no per-video constants.

```bash
python main.py --video match.mp4 --all --device cuda:0
```

That single command runs the **entire** 12-stage pipeline.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎯 **Custom-trained YOLO11m detector** for 4 classes (player · goalkeeper · referee · ball).
- 🔗 **Identity-stable tracking** — BoT-SORT for people + a *dedicated ball tracker* (the ball is too small & fast for IoU tracking), plus appearance-based **stitching** and **swap-correction** to repair broken/swapped IDs.
- 🎽 **Dynamic team & role discovery** — teams are clustered from jersey histograms (numpy-only spherical k-means); goalkeepers/referees split by position & motion. No fixed colours.
- 🗺️ **Automatic pitch calibration** — our own trained keypoint model solves the per-frame **homography** (no manual clicking), smoothed with camera-motion estimation, projecting every player to real **pitch metres**.
- 🏃 **Speed & distance** with smoothing and impossible-jump rejection, shown live under each player.
- 🧠 **Explainable analytics** — per-player performance & 0–10 rating, team tactical profiles, heatmaps, ball possession, and a final **match report**. Every label carries the metric & reason behind it — **no external LLM anywhere**.
- 🖐️ **Human-in-the-loop (optional)** — exactly two reproducible manual touch-points (team multi-select + per-track correction with player names), overlaid on the automatic result so it's never overwritten.
- 🧪 **340+ tests** across 39 modules — runs with no GPU and no weights (fake YOLO model + fake tracker).

## 🏗️ Architecture

A modular, layered system. Each stage is an **independent package** that talks to
the next only through **typed data contracts** (dataclasses) and JSON on disk —
never by passing raw frames around. Any stage can be re-run on a previous
stage's output.

## 🔬 The 12 stages

| # | Stage | What it produces |
|---|-------|------------------|
| 1 | **Detection** | Player / goalkeeper / referee / ball boxes per frame |
| 2 | **Tracking** | Stable IDs (BoT-SORT + ball tracker, stitch + swap-fix) |
| 3 | **Role refinement** | Dynamically discovered teams + GK/referee split |
| 4 | **Manual correction** *(optional)* | Team multi-select + per-track names |
| 5 | **Homography / field projection** | Per-frame player positions in pitch metres |
| 6 | **Minimap & final video** | Tactical top-down map + skeleton broadcast video |
| 7 | **Speed & distance** | Distance covered, avg/max speed per player |
| 8 | **Player performance** | Work rate, fatigue, 0–10 rating + insight |
| 9 | **Heatmaps** | Per-team & best-player positional heatmaps |
| 10 | **Team tactical analysis** | Compactness, press, build-up, attacking zone |
| 11 | **Ball possession** | Field-space possession %, timeline, dominant team |
| 12 | **Match report** | Man of the match, key insights, recommendations |

Every analytics artifact is emitted as both machine-readable **JSON** and
human-readable **TXT**.

## 🚀 Getting started

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mhmdwael77/ai-football-analytics.git
cd ai-football-analytics
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows  (use: source .venv/bin/activate on Linux/macOS)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get the model weights

The trained checkpoints are published on the
**[Releases](../../releases)** page (too large for git). Download them into
`weights/`:

```bash
gh release download v1.0.0 --dir weights/
```

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `weights/best.pt` | YOLO11m detector |
| `weights/pitch_keypoints_yolo11m_best.pt.pt` | Pitch-keypoint / homography model |

See **[weights/README.md](weights/README.md)** for details. The pose model
`yolo11m-pose.pt` is fetched automatically on first use.

### 3. Run it

```bash
# Full pipeline — detection → tracking → roles → calibration → analytics → report
python main.py --video match.mp4 --all --device cuda:0

# Just detection
python main.py --video match.mp4

# Detection + tracking, with a live preview window
python main.py --video match.mp4 --tracking --display

# Quick validation on the first N frames
python main.py --video match.mp4 --all --max-frames 200
```

Outputs land in `outputs/` (annotated videos, minimap, JSON/TXT reports,
heatmaps). All tunables live in **`config/config.yaml`**.

## 📊 Sample output

Real match report produced by the pipeline (see
**[docs/sample_outputs/](docs/sample_outputs/)** for the full set):

```text
MATCH REPORT — input_video
========================================================

Team 0 dominated the match with 59% possession. The standout performer was
Player 21 (Team 1), rated 9.5/10. Tactically: Team 0 counter-attacking,
Team 1 attacking.

Dominant team   : Team 0
Man of the match: Player 21
Weakest player  : Player 37

TEAMS
  Team 0: Counter-Attacking | Mid Block | Compact | Fast transitions
  Team 1: Attacking | High Press | Compact | Fast transitions

KEY INSIGHTS
  - Team 0 controlled possession (59%).
  - Player 21 (Team 1) was the standout at 9.5/10 — Very active and
    frequently involved in play. Covered a lot of ground.
```

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**340+ tests across 39 modules.** No model weights or GPU required — the
detector tests use a fake YOLO model, pipeline tests inject a fake tracker, and
the BoT-SORT integration tests run the real tracker on synthetic detections.

## 🧰 Tech stack

**Python 3.12** · **Ultralytics YOLO11** (detection · pose · BoT-SORT) ·
**OpenCV** · **NumPy** · **PyYAML** · **pytest** · **Streamlit** (optional
manual-correction UI).
